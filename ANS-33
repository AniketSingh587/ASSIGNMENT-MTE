// Sliding Window Technique in Arrays:
//
// It's a method for reducing the time complexity of problems that involve 
// finding subarrays/subsets of elements that meet a condition.
//
// Applications:
// - Maximum or minimum sum of subarrays
// - Longest substring without repeating characters
// - Maximum elements in a window
// - Problems involving contiguous elements with constraints
